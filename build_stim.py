##functions to reconstruct a recruitment curve stim pattern

"""
Leaving off 8/27/19

Need to basically just put things together:

- find files in the folder
- order them according to their start time
- extract the stim amplitude
- create scaled versions of the stim trains
- add the stim trains together spaced by their real time differences
- compute some metrics:
    - ordered amp levels, times between stim onsets, pulses per level
